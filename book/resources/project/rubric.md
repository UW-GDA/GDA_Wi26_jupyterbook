### Problem / Background / Context [3 points]
* Was there sufficient information presented for the audience to understand what the team is trying to accomplish?

### Datasets / Methods [3 points]
* Were datasets and methods discussed, and if so did the team effectively convey how they would be used to answer the research question? 

### Results / Analysis [5 points]
* Did the team convey their results effectively? 
* Quality visual aids?

### Conclusion / Future Directions [3 points]
* Did the team describe their interpretation of their results? 
* Did they attempt to answer their research question? 
* Did they describe shortcomings or next steps in this project were to be continued?	

### Overall Organization / Flow / Clarity [3 points]	
* Was the presentation structured well? 
* Did the team effectively convey information?

### Within Time Limit [1 points]
* Did the team finish their presentation in time? 
   * Time limits will be announced once we have a better idea of how many total projects we’ll have! Plan for ~5-7 minutes per project group

### Q&A [2 points]	
* Were the audience’s questions given a good faith attempt to answer?

### Project Documentation / Reproducibility [5 points]
* Is there enough information for an observer to understand what was done and how it was done? 
* Given the same data, would an observer be able to understand what notebooks and packages were used to get the same results?
