## Overview
In modules 4 and 6 we used rioxarray to read and analyze rasters which were represented as xarray DataArray objects. Module 7 introduces advanced capabilities of Xarray for handling multidimensional geospatial data. In particular, we will work with N-dimensional arrays (NDarrays) that incorporate a time dimension alongside spatial coordinates, enabling time series analysis of raster data.

## Reading and Tutorials
Please take some time to review the following material, and come with questions on topics that are unclear, so we can discuss together.
