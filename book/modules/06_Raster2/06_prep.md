## Overview
This week, we are going to revisit rasters. We will cover common operations and strategies, including reprojection, clipping, sampling, and zonal statistics.

## Reading and Tutorials
Please take some time to review the following material (especially if you have limited GIS experience), and come with questions on topics that are unclear, so we can discuss together.
