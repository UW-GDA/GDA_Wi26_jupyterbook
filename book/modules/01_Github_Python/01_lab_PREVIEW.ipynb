    "Lab 1 is focused on understanding the potential of geospatial data, navigating the command line, getting comfortable with using python in jupyter notebooks, and using git and github to manage your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first section of this lab, we will see examples of geospatial data and show off some of the applications we will get to later in the quarter. In the second section of this lab, we'll get more familiar with navigating the command line. In the third and fourth section of the lab, we'll practice the basics of using python in jupyter notebooks. Finally, we will practice using git and github to submit your work.\n",
