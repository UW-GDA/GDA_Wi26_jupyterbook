    - If you're not able to log on, please let us know ASAP

## Jupyterhub overview

    - start a shell
    - start a notebook
    - storage and persistence
    - our jupyterhub will be shut down on June 13th, 2025
- Where is this running??

## Shell overview
- Discussion of prompt (jovyan)
- Disucssion of file system navigation (all the way to /)
- Commands and arguments
- Tab completion
- `ls -l` - modificaiton timestamps

## Set up git on Jupyterhub
- https://gda-wi25-jupyterbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources/github.html#first-time-login
- Set up token

## Basic git / Github workflow
1. Make sure to accept the Github classroom starter assignment (link pinned to `#general` on slack)
2. git vs. github, local vs remote 
3. Use `git clone` to download it to the Jupyterhub
4. Try a `git status`
5. Put your name on the assignment on the remote repository
6. Try a `git status`
7. Try `git pull`
8. Now add the date to the assignment on the local repository
9. `git status`
10. Use `git add`, `git commit -m "your commit message here"`, and `git push` to push your work up! 
11. Store credentials so you don't have to enter the token every time!
12. Try `git log`

## Lab 01 assignment (due NEXT Friday)
1. Create `labs` folder
1. Distribute week 01 lab assignment link through slack channel 
1. Clone assignment locally into the labs folder - be careful of where you clone!!
1. Add a folder `ramblings`
1. Add a file in that folder called `my_thoughts_on_git.txt` 
1. Add some of your thoughts
1. Practice the add, commit, push workflow!

We will go over and work on the lab together this Friday. Please come prepared by doing this weeks reading assignment--the feedback form is due this Friday before class.
